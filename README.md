# Multidimensional-Array

# Tools Required:
1) C++ Compiler: Such as GCC (g++), Clang, or MS Visual C++ Compiler. A text editor or an IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or Eclipse CDT is also helpful.
2) Debugger (optional): For inspecting the contents of multidimensional arrays during program execution.

# Theory: 
A multidimensional array in C++ is an array of arrays, which allows you to represent data in two or more dimensions. The most common use is the two-dimensional array (matrix), but arrays of higher dimensions are also possible.

Syntax:
data_type array_name[size1][size2]...[sizeN];

Memory layout:
C++ stores multidimensional arrays in row-major order. This means all elements of a row are stored in contiguous memory locations.

Accessing elements:
Use multiple indices: matrix[row][column].

Applications:

Mathematical matrices

Image processing (pixels in an image)

Storing tables of data

Scientific computations

# Conclusion:
Multidimensional arrays in C++ provide a structured way to organize and process data in two or more dimensions. Their declaration, memory management, and element access are foundational for a range of applications, from graphics to scientific computing. Mastery of these arrays is essential for efficient data processing in many engineering and technical domains.
